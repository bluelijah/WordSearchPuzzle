run the searchPuzzle and return a bool if the word is fully found (success or failure)
print (Printing the search path: )
print out the matrix with the search path with values increasing for each index of the matrix in relation to each index of the word

//a for loop that iters through the whole matrix, and stores the locations of every letter that is equal to the first letter of the search word CHECKMARK
//8 functions, one that goes in each direction CHECKMARK
//if one of those functions finds the second letter of the search word CHECKMARK
//we upd the search letter, (3rd letter) CHECKMARK
//make an array [2][2] CHECKMARK
//check equality of every letter within i-1, i+1, j-1, j+1, with the second letter of the word CHECKMARK
// [2][2], [2][3], [3][4] CHECKMARK
